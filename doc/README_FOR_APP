= Basecamp Mobile

== Introduction

This is a small rails application that provides access to Basecamp (http://www.basecamphq.com) in a format suitable for mobile phones.  

Basecamp Mobile was created by Alex Young (http://alexyoung.org) and is released under the MIT license by Helicoid (http://helicoid.net).

Run "rake appdoc" to generate API documentation.


== Installation and usage

Installation depends on how your server is set up.  However, you can start it up quickly by using WEBrick from the command line:

  ruby script/server


== Hacking

Since Basecamp Mobile has been packaged as a rails application, some effort has gone into making the "models" appear like ActiveRecord objects.  This is largely to keep code in controllers and views simple and familiar.

basecamp.rb provides a ruby abstraction of the Basecamp API.  I have written basecamp_extensions.rb and basecamp_wrapper.rb to add a few extra things to basecamp.rb.  By keeping my extensions separate and using some meta-programming it should provide some abstraction between Basecamp Mobile and the API, should the API change in the future.  New features in rails or suitable libraries will hopefully make the wrapper obsolete.

Models can be used in a familiar fashion:

  Project.find(project_id)
  Project.find_all
  Project.find(project_id).messages
  Project.find(project_id).milestones
  Project.find(project_id).todos

== Help wanted

I haven't had time to develop a caching strategy so far, and if you use Basecamp Mobile for any length of time you might notice it's slightly slow.  To get started I used a few helpers that cache objects in the session, and I used the Basecamp Wrapper class to begin work on creating (what should be eventually) ActiveRecord-like objects.  A good strategy will probably use this, and creating an observer-like caching system using what's already in rails.

To get talking to me about this, or submit your own code, begin a conversation on our forum (http://forums.helicoid.net) or send a quick message to me (http://alexyoung.org/contact).
